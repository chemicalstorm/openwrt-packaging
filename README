This is an OpenWrt package feed containing my custom packages.

To use these packages, add the following line to the feeds.conf
in the OpenWrt buildroot:

  src-git chemicalstorm http://git.chemicalstorm.org/cgit.cgi/openwrt-packaging/
  
Update the feed:

  ./scripts/feeds update chemicalstorm
  
Activate the package:

  ./scripts/feeds install -a -p chemicalstorm
  
The packages should now appear in menuconfig.
